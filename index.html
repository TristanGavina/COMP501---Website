                <h3>Defining the topic</h3>
                        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved rapidly in the past 5 years, advancing in neural 
                            networks, speech recognition, natural language processing and more (Littman et al., 2021), 
                            which led to the creation of Generative AI as we know it today. Since the development of 
                            Generative AI models using GPT, students can now receive immediate feedback on 
                            questions relating to course concepts and ideas, which when used as a tool, can solidify 
                            students understanding and knowledge. Mao (2023) defines Generative AI as a system 
                            “which utilizes machine learning algorithms designed to respond to prompts and generate 
                            new context across various formats, including text, audio, images, code, simulations, and 
                            videos” (p. 58). Currently, researchers in academia and education are assessing the 
                            educational and ethical implications that Generative AI has in assisting student learning 
                            and assessment work. </p>

    <section id="topic">
            <h1>Justification of Topic Selection</h1>

                    <p>Teachers are often overwhelmed with the number of responsibilities they have, making it 
                        challenging to provide feedback to each student in their class. Generative AI (GenAI) can 
                        step in to provide students with immediate feedback on any question they have, until they 
                        have a more nuanced understanding of a topic or concept. </p>

                    <p>AI can make education more accessible and personalized, suiting various learning styles for 
                        students (Huang et al., 2021, p. 211), which can improve academic success and allow 
                        teachers to focus on more complex areas of their education. The emergence of GenAI such 
                        as ChatGPT, Claude, and Google Gemini can be used for interactive learning, where students 
                        can receive ongoing immediate feedback by students using prompts for any questions they 
                        have regarding their studies. These AI’s use Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) 
                        models, which are trained on publicly available data, to process and produce human-like 
                        text (Aydin & Karaarslan, 2023, p. 22), and has shown promise in aiding students learn 
                        content when used as a tool due to its large extensive training data, including academic 
                        concepts. </p>

                    <p>However, there are ethical concerns about the disruption of existing educational practices, 
                        providing misinformation, plagiarism, and academic integrity with the use of GenAI in 
                        assignment work. GenAI like ChatGPT is not 100% accurate and the accuracy of the 
                        information it produced must be verified by the user. The over-reliance of GenAI in 
                        education could not only give students a false understanding of topics if not used correctly 
                        and decline critical thinking skills but could diminish the teacher-student relationship and 
                        social skills that students develop through collaborating in their classes. </p>

                <h3>Background of generative AI and its implementation into education</h3>
                        <p>Early generative AI development began in the 1950’s and 1960’s with models like Hidden 
                            Markov Models (HMMS) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), which generated 
                            sequential data like speech (Cao et al., 2023). The field gained a lot of traction with the rise 
                            of deep learning in 2010 with the development of neural networks and Generative 
                            Adversarial Networks (GANs) in 2014. GAN’s were used for image generation research, 
                            consisting of a generator and a discriminator, where the generator would try learn the 
                            distribution of real examples to create new data, while the discriminator would determine 
                            if the input was from the real data space or not (Cao et al., 2023). This success then 
                            allowed more advanced generative models to be developed, such as transformers, which 
                            are the foundation of models like GPT. The development of these models has drastically 
                            improved the ability for GenAI to create convincing human-like text, images, and other 
                            content, that has inevitably been adopted by students and teachers in higher education. </p>

        <section id="oppurtunity">
            <h1>Opportunities</h1>

                <p>The use of generative AI holds many opportunities if used appropriately in higher 
                    education. A study by Chan & Hu explored students' perceptions on the use of generative 
                    AI, such as ChatGPT, in higher education. Students said that a key use of Generative AI is to 
                    enhance their learning due to its ability to respond to students prompts and answer 
                    accordingly (Chan & Hu, 2023, p. 2). International students can use this technology for 
                    assistance in their writing, providing an efficient and comfortable platform for students to 
                    receive feedback on their vocabulary and grammar. A quick google search shows that 
                    English language tutors' range between $20 - $38/h on average, with some charging 
                    between $50 - $150 (information obtained from superprof.co.nz, 17.09.2024). Many 
                    students do not have access to these resources as they must pay for other necessities like 
                    food, rent and bills, and so the use of GenAI can provide similar learning if prompted 
                    correctly, however this could reduce the amount of people seeing private tutors and 
                    potentially affect the tutor's income. Other benefits mentioned were GenAI being used as a 
                    research assistant, synthesizing information, composing writing, idea generation (Cherinka 
                    & Prezzama, 2023, p. 91), all of which are tasks students must do in their assignments. 
                    When used as a research assistant, GenAI can make research more accessible, validate 
                    existing theories and enhance the quality of research. GenAI can make academic journals 
                    and reports more accessible to a wider audience, due to its ability to summarize complex 
                    papers into language that is easier for the reader to understand. The idea generation 
                    capabilities of GenAI can provide new ideas or suggest alternative approaches that the 
                    student may not have considered, which may foster critical and deeper thinking.  </p>

                <h3>Creating study materials </h3>
                    
                    <p>GenAI chatbots can create assessments using specific prompts based on lecture notes or 
                        learning materials to ask the student unfamiliar questions. The use of GenAI chatbots in 
                        this manner encourages critical thinking and an authentic application of knowledge. This 
                        accompanied with immediate feedback to any questions the student may have about 
                        questions in the generated assessments can contribute to this. An example of a GenAI that 
                        can do this currently is Thea AI, which can provide study guides, generate flashcards, and 
                        generate tests based on university course outlines. Tools like these could really add to 
                        education as they foster critical thinking. </p>
                
                <h3>AI powered search queries </h3>
                        <p>Some GenAI such as perplexity have real-time access to the internet and are designed to 
                            provide accurate and relevant responses to complex questions. Perplexity cites the sources 
                            it pulls its information from in its response. Students often search for a specific question 
                            that takes searching through many sources to get an answer. GenAI like these almost 
                            eliminate this problem, providing an answer immediately, which should still be verified. 
                            This can take less time to get an answer or understanding than searching through various 
                            sources. These AI’s can also recommend or link specific reading materials or exercises for a 
                            concept after introducing it to them. </p>
                    
                <h3>Personalized active learning</h3>
                            <p>GenAI chatbots can create personalized learning paths for students based on their 
                                preferred learning style strengths and weaknesses if prompted correctly. For example, a 
                                popular learning style or technique is The Feynman Technique developed by Richard 
                                Feynman that involves a student teaching themselves and/or someone else a concept they 
                                are learning and engaging in a conversation with them to identify areas of the concept they 
                                are not confident with. It also involves simplifying explanations and creating analogies. 
                                Whilst this technique is better used with another human, GenAI can simulate the role that 
                                another human plays in this learning technique by asking questions about the topic you are 
                                explaining, allowing the student to identify gaps in their knowledge. New voice chat 
                                features in ChatGPT and Metas’ Llama AI make this even easier as the student does not 
                                have to type but can simply explain the concept using their voice. </p>

        <section id="risk">
            <h1>Risks</h1>
                <p>Despite the advantages that GenAI can provide, there are challenges/risks associated with 
                    the use of GenAI when used in learning content for assignments in higher education. Risks 
                    such as misinformation, the overreliance on AI, plagiarism, and academic integrity with the 
                    use of GenAI in assignment work may disrupt existing educational practices.  </p>

            <h3>Misinformation / Hallucinations</h3>
                <p>A primary risk associated with the use of GenAI in higher education is the potential for 
                    misinformation. GenAI has been known to produce misinformation as we have seen in 
                    various sectors such as healthcare, where serious negative impacts could occur with the 
                    use of AI-generated information like factual errors, fabricated sources, and dangerous 
                    advice (Monteith et al., 2023, p. 33). This information can be convincing but factually 
                    incorrect, and for students, this may involve students making decisions or conclusions 
                    based off false information or claims they have found using GenAI such as ChatGPT, Claude 
                    or Gemini. </p>

            <h3>Over-reliance and Critical Thinking</h3>
                <p>Additional to misinformation, the over-reliance on AI could hinder people’s growth, 
                    problem solving skills and critical thinking skills (Iskender, 2023). One participant in Chan 
                    & Hu’s study said that “this may lead to a decrease in critical thinking and make decisions 
                    only based on the information that AI provides them” (Chan & Hu, 2023, p. 11). This is 
                    concerning because information that AI provides can be false and/or biased which may 
                    only reinforce these existing biases already present in society. Additionally, the over-
                    reliance on GenAI for idea generation in assignments could negatively impact the student's 
                    creativity and make them lose a part of their ability to think for themselves. A part of being 
                    a student involves being able to effectively search for information, analyze, and synthesize 
                    this information, and draw original conclusions based on knowledge from other topics and 
                    life experiences. The over-reliance of GenAI in assignments skips these processes, which 
                    are all important processes in academia and the workplace. Over-reliance in GenAI could 
                    erode critical thinking and problem-solving skills. </p>

                <p>Whilst GenAI chatbots are great tools for students who don’t have access to a teacher or 
                    peer at a point in time, students using AI instead of interacting with teachers or peers when 
                    they have this opportunity would be reducing their opportunities to engage in meaningful 
                    communication. Over-reliance in this manner could decline students' social skills, 
                    collaboration, and teamwork. </p>

            <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
                <p>There are concerns regarding plagiarism and academic integrity, because GenAI models are 
                    trained on huge amounts of publicly available data, so responses may unintentionally 
                    contain plagiarized content. These responses can resemble or entirely replicate existing 
                    work, which could make students at a higher risk of academic misconduct without their 
                    knowledge, although using AI in assignments is typically already breaching academic 
                    integrity. A significant number of students are already using generate AI for their 
                    coursework, raising questions about the integrity of their submitted work and whether 
                    their grades are a true reflection of the student’s knowledge. </p>

            <h3>Diminished information literacy</h3>
                <p>Information is the ability to find, evaluate, use and communicate information, which is an 
                    essential skill in learning (Saranto & Hovenga, 2004). This involves evaluating sources, 
                    recognizing bias, verifying facts and identifying misinformation, which is essential in this 
                    age of readily available information, some being AI generated and some real. Generative AI 
                    provides immediate answers which could discourage students from engaging in research 
                    practices like cross-referencing sources, understanding context, checking analysis data 
                    and verifying facts. This could negatively impact students' information literacy. </p>

        </section>
        <hr />
        <section id="choice">
            <h1>Choices</h1>
                <p>There are really two choices; we either integrate the use of GenAI as a tool in the learning 
                    process in higher education or we don’t. Regardless of whether this technology is formally 
                    adopted into education, students and likely teachers are going to be using generative AI in 
                    some way.  </p>

                <p>The risks that this technology holds has many potential impacts on the individual level as 
                    mentioned, which could affect groups of people and in turn impact organizations in terms 
                    of dealing with ethical implications like plagiarism, data privacy, and intellectual property 
                    concerns. With the possible shift in learning culture where students rely on AI for learning, 
                    this could affect global things such as academic journals and the reliability of information 
                    found online that we use for learning. AI generated content, if continued to be used 
                    incorrectly, could find its way into academic journals, that people who dont use AI would 
                    be affected by. This could create a lot of distrust in the validity of online information. </p>

                <p>The adoption of GenAI in assisting learning content for assignments in higher education 
                    must be done considering ethics, curriculum integration and perhaps placing a greater 
                    emphasis on in person-controlled exams or assessments. Whilst the use of GenAI has many 
                    benefits to the learning process if used correctly, there will still be students who abuse this 
                    and use it to complete all their assignments or assessments, rather than using it as a 
                    learning tool. </p>

                <p>The use of AI generated content like passages of text should not be allowed in assignments, 
                    but this would be difficult to enforce as current generative AI detection tools have been 
                    found to exhibit inconsistencies and produce false positives at times (Ordi & Ji Yun Yoon, 
                    2023). AI is only getting more money invested into it and its continuing to improve in many 
                    different areas but has particularly improved in creating convincing passages of text that 
                    sound like a human wrote it. OpenAI announced their new reasoning model that has shown 
                    significant improvements in completing complex reasoning tasks (OpenAI, 2024), which 
                    have only made these models better and likely less detectable in assignments. </p>

                <p>This issue could potentially be minimized through placing greater weighting on in person-
                    controlled exams, as studies have suggested that traditional exams can be more reflective 
                    of a student's understanding of a topic as their ability to recall, analyze, and apply this 
                    knowledge is assessed without external resources. If greater emphasis is placed on in 
                    person assessments, students will have an incentive to learn the content rather than have 
                    AI complete it for them, potentially promoting the use of GenAI as a learning tool. However, 
                    implementing this could have issues with inclusion and accessibility for students with 
                    learning disabilities such as ADHD, anxiety of dyslexia as these conditions can significantly 
                    reduce a student's ability to perform well in exams.  </p>
                
                <p>Whilst the incorporation of generative AI chatbots in higher education could revolutionize 
                    the learning process by providing students with personalized assistance in their learning, 
                    responsible integration of these tools with clear ethical guidelines must be established and 
                    followed. Academic integrity must be maintained by encouraging students to use AI-
                    generated content to aid their learning rather than completing their assignments without 
                    critically thinking. This could create a learning environment that values honesty and 
                    understanding. Lecturers should also engage with students and teach them the importance 
                    of active learning, fact checking and verifying information or AI generated responses 
                    (Slotnick & Boeing, 2024), as these are common issues associated with the use of 
                    generative AI. Instead of discouraging students from using generative AI chatbots they 
                    should embrace the technology because it's really up to the students whether they see 
                    value in their education or not.  </p>

                <p>GenAI tools or tutors could be implemented into existing education systems such as an AI 
                    tutor or tool implemented into canvas that has access to lecture slides, and selected 
                    information from textbooks and other relevant sources that perhaps the lecturer would 
                    choose. This could allow students who are watching the lecture to ask related questions 
                    during or after the lecture without interrupting the lecturer. This would benefit students 
                    through the efficiency and personalization of the response to their answer.  </p>

                <p>What is and what isn't academic integrity in terms of using generative AI could also be re-
                    evaluated. For example, should the use of GenAI as a research tool to summarize or compile 
                    information from different sources be allowed? We are in a time where GenAI is 
                    unavoidable, and this tool should somehow be implemented into our learning process with 
                    care rather than avoided. </p>
