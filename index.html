        <h3 class ="Define">Defining the topic</h3>
                <p class ="define-para">Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved rapidly in the past 5 years, advancing in neural 
            networks, speech recognition, natural language processing and more (Littman et al., 2021), 
            which led to the creation of Generative AI as we know it today. Since the development of 
            Generative AI models using GPT, students can now receive immediate feedback on 
            questions relating to course concepts and ideas, which when used as a tool, can solidify 
            students understanding and knowledge. Mao (2023) defines Generative AI as a system 
            “which utilizes machine learning algorithms designed to respond to prompts and generate 
            new context across various formats, including text, audio, images, code, simulations, and 
            videos” (p. 58). Currently, researchers in academia and education are assessing the 
            educational and ethical implications that Generative AI has in assisting student learning 
            and assessment work. </p>

        <h3 class ="justify">Justification of Topic Selection</h3>
                <p class = "just-cont">Teachers are often overwhelmed with the number of responsibilities they have, making it 
            challenging to provide feedback to each student in their class. Generative AI (GenAI) can 
            step in to provide students with immediate feedback on any question they have, until they 
            have a more nuanced understanding of a topic or concept.

                <p class = "just-cont">AI can make education more accessible and personalized, suiting various learning styles for 
            students (Huang et al., 2021, p. 211), which can promote academic success and allow 
            teachers to focus on more complex areas of their education. The emergence of GenAI such 
            as ChatGPT, Claude, and Google Gemini can be used for interactive learning, where students 
            can receive ongoing immediate feedback by students using prompts for any questions they 
            have regarding their studies. These AI’s use Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) 
            models, which are trained on publicly available data, to process and produce human-like 
            text (Aydin & Karaarslan, 2023, p. 22), and has shown promise in aiding students learn 
            content when used as a tool due to its extensive dataset of academic concepts (find a reference).

                <p class = "just-cont">However, there are ethical concerns about the disruption of existing educational practices, 
            providing misinformation, plagiarism, and academic integrity with the use of GenAI in 
            assignment work. GenAI like ChatGPT is not 100% accurate and the accuracy of the 
            information it produced must be verified by the user. The over-reliance of GenAI in 
            education could not only give students a false understanding of topics if not used correctly 
            and decline critical thinking skills but could diminish the teacher-student relationship and 
            social skills that students develop through collaborating in their classes.</p>
        
            <h3 class = "opportunity">Opportunities</h3>
                <p class="opp-cont">The use of generative AI holds many opportunities if used appropriately in higher 
                    education. A study by Chan & Hu explored students' perceptions on the use of generative 
                    AI, such as ChatGPT, in higher education. Students said that a key use of Generative AI is to 
                    enhance their learning due to its ability to respond to students prompts and answer 
                    accordingly (Chan & Hu, 2023, p. 2).. International students can use this technology for 
                    assistance in their writing, providing an efficient and comfortable platform for students to 
                    receive feedback on their vocabulary and grammar. A quick google search shows that 
                    English language tutors' range between $20 - $38/h on average, with some charging 
                    between $50 - $150 (information obtained from superprof.co.nz, 17.09.2024). Many 
                    students do not have access to these resources as they must pay for other necessities like 
                    food, rent and bills, and so the use of GenAI can provide similar learning if prompted 
                    correctly, however this could reduce the amount of people seeing private tutors and 
                    potentially affect the tutor's income. Other benefits mentioned were GenAI being used as a 
                    research assistant, synthesizing information, composing writing, idea generation (Cherinka 
                    & Prezzama, 2023, p. 91), all of which are tasks students must do in their assignments. 
                    When used as a research assistant, GenAI can make research more accessible, validate 
                    existing theories and enhance the quality of research. GenAI can make academic journals 
                    and reports more accessible to a wider audience, due to its ability to summarize complex 
                    papers into language that is easier for the reader to understand. The idea generation 
                    capabilities of GenAI can provide new ideas or suggest alternative approaches that the 
                    student may not have considered, which may foster critical and deeper thinking.</p>
            <h3 class="risk">Risks</h3>
                <p class="risk-main">Think about how AI has evolved, involve the past, present and future applications of 
                    generative AI in education and the impacts this has on society in general, as well as 
                    on the individual level (current impacts and potential impacts). </p>
                <p class="risk-cont">Despite the advantages that GenAI can provide, there are challenges/risks associated with 
                    the use of GenAI when used in learning content for assignments in higher education. Risks 
                    such as misinformation, the overreliance on AI, plagiarism, and academic integrity with the 
                    use of GenAI in assignment work may disrupt existing educational practices.  </p>
